# Hi there!
My name is Joey and I'm a customer-obsessed technology leader passionate about evolving the intersection of technology and people. This has led me to spending the last 20 years focusing on product, engineering, and go-to-market functions across cloud, IoT, Edge, and AI/ML domains.

- 💻 I lead Partner Engineering and Enablement at Wind River Systems, helping revolutionize the embedded SDLC.
- 🔗 I used to lead Product Strategy for Azure IoT, connecting 150+ million devices..
- 🦈 I built the cloud platform behind two different products on Shark Tank ([UniKey](https://vimeo.com/478206628), [Haven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D83MdEeYe6g)) - who had arguably the *best* and the *funniest* pitches there have been.
- 🧑‍💼 You can find me on linkedin at [linkedin.com/in/jlorich](https://linkedin.com/in/jlorich)
- 📃 My [resume](https://github.com/jlorich/resume) is built here on GitHub with LaTeX, DevContainers, and Codespaces!
