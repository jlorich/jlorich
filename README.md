# Hi there!
My name is Joey and I'm a customer-obsessed technology leader passionate about evolving the intersection of technology and people. This has led me to spending the last 20 years focusing on product, engineering, and go-to-market functions across cloud, IoT, Edge, and AI/ML domains.

- 💻 I lead Partner Engineering and Enablement at Wind River Systems, helping revolutionize the embedded SDLC.
- 🔗 I used to lead Strategy for Azure IoT, connecting >150M device used by hundreds of millions of people.
- 🦈 I built the cloud platform behind two different products seen on *Shark Tank* ([UniKey](https://vimeo.com/478206628), [Haven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D83MdEeYe6g)).
- 🧑‍💼 You can find me on linkedin at [linkedin.com/in/jlorich](https://linkedin.com/in/jlorich).
